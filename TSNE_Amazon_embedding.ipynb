Brown one has (pointless) decorative centre seam (as usually illustrated) front and rear. Front seam stitching has no reinforcing at lighter pocket opening.

Plus it's see-through. My face and hair were visible through it.\\n\\nThe only good thing is that it's breathable. Not what i was looking for though.\"],[\"I am very disappointed with this item.  First, in moderately cold skiing weather 10-20 degrees fahrenheit, my face was a little cold through this mask.  While skiing downhill, the wind shred through this mask.  Second, after only 1 weekend of moderate use, the front of the mask was worn away.  I would not be surprised if it tore during the 2nd weekend of use.  Third, I have a medium sized head and this thing was wayyyy too big for me.  Finally, the mask traps the moisture of my breath and freezes it, making the mask uncomfortable around the mouth area.\\n\\nThe only pros are that it is lightweight and breathable.\"],[\"my son has to wait on a main road to catch the school bus and he does not get cold from cars driving by and creating wind.

It is a very nice ring - shiny, smooth nice weight\\u002fwidth!  Very impressed.\"],[\"This ring was well worth the price. It has a lovely shine and fits true to size. It is a very light, thin ring, so it you want something heavy with a thicker consistency to the metal, this may not be for you but as I said it is well worth the price! I'm very pleased.\"],[\"When I first saw this offer last year, I couldn't believe it was genuine. I was used to paying $10 to $15 a pair for wool socks. When they arrived, I still found it hard to believe. But these are excellent quality socks that have held up well through heavy use and lots of washings. The three pair are serving well alongside their far more expensive drawer-mates. It's hard to imagine someone getting excited by a pair of socks, but these are worth getting excited about. I agree that a color other than gray would help to stretch these socks further in my wardrobe, but for the price... I ain't complainin'!\"],[\"My first review but I have to say......About 15 years ago I developed an allergy to nickle (earrings, necklaces, belt buckles, buttons, bracelets!) and stopped wearing most jewelry. I have to tape over my belt buckles or any metal that contacts my skin and was diagnosed as severely allergic by my doc after allergy skin test. About a year ago I got my ears repierced with my daughter so we could have fun wearing jewelry and have tried every kind of hypo allergenic earring I could find: Studex, Sterling Silver 925, Surgical Steel, 14k gold, and had allergic reactions to all of them if worn for even an hour. Studex that my ears were pierced with was the worst! Bleeding, red itchy swollen earlobes a few weeks to heal in between each time I wore earrings! Searched Amazon for an hour to find these and did some research. They work as promised! I had to force them through (holes had partially closed) and had some initial healing for about 2 weeks. Now I'm wearing them 24\\u002f7 no problems! It's a first and really wonderful. I will get more. This size is a bit small for a main earring so I will get the next size up. THANK YOU.\"],[\"It is refreshing to wear these earrings because they don't make my earlobes swell up. My ears are too sensitive for \\\"sensitive\\\" earrings and I was about ready to give up and resign myself to clip earrings. Fortunately I found these. They are more expensive than other earrings due to the metal, but well worth it. It's like my ears don't even know they're there :) .\"],[\"I just got these a few weeks ago (along with a pair of titanium hoops) and love them. I haven't been able to wear earrings for years because of nickel allergies, and these earrings haven't given me any trouble whatsoever!\"],[\"these are the only earrings that have not caused an allergic reaction and they are very pretty too.\"],[\"I have only owned these earrings a few weeks, but I'm quite pleased with them.  Before buying these, I had been completely unable to wear earrings for many years.  My earlobes would swell, turn red, and bleed immediately after inserting even \\\"hypoallergenic\\\" earrings.  I've tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn't wear them.  I'd given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn't bought or tried any earrings for a few years.\\n\\nWhen these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven't bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.\\n\\nI noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.\\n\\nI highly recommend these for people with metal allergies - I'm planning to get another pair.\"],[\"The Suspenders are fine except one of the tongues or the buckles was put it the wrong way and the fastening of this one is not as secure as the correct buckle and the tongue sticks awkwardly out. I will have to take it to a leather shop to have the problem fixed. Other than that product is fine.\"],[\"These leather suspenders I highly recomend. They are simple, and compfortable. Easy to adjust. Look great!\"],[\"I have worn suspenders for quite a few years.  It is nice to buy a pair that really feels solid and comfortable.  From the construction to the materials used, I am impressed.  They look good in casual dress or on my jeans and really stand up to a hard days work.\"],[\"Actually I didn't buy them as liner gloves. I was looking for a light weight glove with some flexibility and durability. These fit the bill. They are perfect for dog walking in moderate winter weather. Fingers are a little short but they still work.\"],[\"1.13.12 UPDATE: I've now been using these gloves through all of December and half of January and I continue to recommend them. Many of my runs have taken place in temperatures within the 20s, and while the gloves are not winter gloves, they are working out. My hands are cold as I start my run and the tips of my fingers do sting initially, but after about half a mile or a mile, I've warmed up enough that my hands become comfortable. In fact, I think if I were wearing anything heavier, the warmth of the gloves might become too much. These allow me to go for 8-mile runs without feeling like I have to take them off. As long as you're okay starting your run with slightly cold hands, these could be for you.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using these gloves on and off for about a month now, and so far I've found them to be a great purchase. I usually go for runs around 5 a.m., and this has allowed me to test them out in temps that have resided in the mid-30s. So far, so good. They do the job. If I remember, I'll post an update once the weather gets even colder.\\n\\nMy only concern is the fit. I'm an average size guy, and there's something a little uncomfortable about the way they fit, as if the fingers could've been cut lower, that makes me think I'd have an issue with them if I were a taller guy with bigger hands. That being said, I'd purchase these again if I had to do it all over again. At this price point, you can't beat them.\"],[\"Had a pair of these for the past few years. same thing... great gloves for running and even short (1-2 hour long) bike rides in the cold.\"],[\"These gloves are good for running, but won't keep your hands warm if it's too windy. My only concern is about their durability. I've used them last winter for running (in Fayetteville, AR) and while traveling in Montana (Glacier and Yellowstone) during the end of Spring. The knits are starting to get loose, and I don't know how much longer they'll endure.\"],[\"Awesome gloves.  They're thin enough that you almost forget you have them on, but they're thick enough to keep my hands warm.  I'm in California so the coldest weather I have to run in is probably about 50 degrees.  Hard to beat at this price\"],[\"Good product, good transaction\"],[\"These are really pretty. I love Silver Forest earrings. Wish I could find merchants who honor their earring club. No one seems to carry the card\\u002fstickers needed to receive a free pair.\"],[\"I would buy jewerly from this buyer again. The earrings where nice and shipped right away!\"],[\"These are just gorgeous.  I received several compliments on them when i wore them to work.  seller was prompt.  very satisfied with service.\"],[\"Over quite a few years I've bought and worn Silver Forest jewelry, especially earrings, and used to get so many compliments on them.  Unfortunately, their aesthetic has changed over time, away from what made their pieces special and interesting.  Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly \\\"pretty\\\" aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.  Such things are not bad, necessarily, but the variety is gone, and their pieces are just not very special anymore.  I'm very disappointed and will probably not seek out their products as I have over the years.  Too bad.\"],[\"Nice fun earrings good color. Not heavy or cheap looking. Certainly not what you would want for a formal but great easy wearing earrings.\"],[\"This product has a different pitcher then what you actually get.. don't get it.. the back is not Turquoise, its just a pic of plastic.\"],[\"Before I purchased these earrings, others had commented on their poor quality.  These are cute but not really a very high quality.\"],[\"Package arrived promptly and in good shape. Loved these beautiful earrings. I ordered them for a gift but almost kept them for myself. May have to order another pair for myself.\"],[\"Purchased with a necklace on amazon and these match perfectly.  The size is just right and they are so unique that I get compliments on them.\"],[\"I was very disappointed when I received these earrings I ordered from Amazon. They are very small and the \\\"turquoise\\\" background is actually plastic with a small piece of turquoise mounted to the metal (not silver). When I purchased these, they were advertised as sale priced from $40 to $18.  Now they're advertised at $13.50. These are not the quality I expected, and I won't be ordering jewelry again.\"],[\"received ear rings and very very happy with the quality, color and style.  Will purchase another pair for my daughter. The only down side, is it needs some kind of backing. these come off my ears without me knowing it and I don't want to lose them. Otherwise, they are great!!!!!\"],[\"Bought for a gift and they look so good want to keep for myself!  I am impressed with these earrings.\"],[\"Watch out with these.  I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart.  The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off.  They are useless now.  Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive.  The back of the earring is a flat separate piece of plastic and is not connected to the metal part of the earring so it flaps around.\\n\\nThese are cheap and fall apart quickly.\"],[\"So far I am very pleased with these less expensive versions of Birkenstocks. Haven't noticed any lack in quality and of course love the comfort of these shoes. Birkenstocks (and Betula's) are the best!\"],[\"I have been looking for this particular style of Birkenstock for over two years.  I already own a pair just like this and, unfortunately, they got wet so they don't look new anymore.  I was so happy to find them.  They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  I have flat feet and most shoes aren't very easy to wear for a very long period of time.  I can wear these all day and not only do my feet not hurt but my back doesn't either.  This was a great find!!\"],[\"I love my sandals. They are the second pair I've bought. The first pair were clogs and I love them too. I wear my sandals all the time. I would reccomend them to anyone for themselves or as presents for others.\"],[\"Wearing the same style Betulas purchased years ago (and they're still going strong!), I was so sure of my size that I ordered 3 new pairs in assorted colors. Well, no such luck. The footbeds of the \\\"new\\\" size 38's are slightly smaller than on my old sandals. My toes were hitting the edge of the footbed. Not comfortable at all. (I'm a size 7 in regular shoes).\\n\\nSo, I had to return them at my expense, and then pay the shipping to get the larger sized relacements sent to me. Now the fronts fit fine, but on the whole, the new size is a bit too large for the rest of my feet!\\n\\nSo, go to the mall and try them on first before buying, for best results.\"],[\"Betula is similar to Birkenstock, not the same and much less expensive. The cork sole looks and feels different and the arch is not as prominent as in Birkenstock. Overall they are a nice alternative.\"],[\"Shoes were just what I wanted and the price was exceptional.  Service was great - got my order in just a couple of days\"],[\"I have all hardwood floors in my house and wanted\\u002fneeded a good pair of shoes to wear in the house that would support my feet.\\nThese are great. They arrived timely and are exactly what I needed. Plus they are very reasonably priced for having the comfort and benefits of Birkenstocks, but without the Birkenstock price.\"],[\"very nice shirt.

It angles up at the tip which makes dancing not as easy or graceful aa I was looking\\u002fhoping for. The platform sandal version of this boot by the same company has a flat\\u002flevel toe - PERFECT for dancing and walking. I hoped this boot would be the same, but it's not. :( Making them work, but disappointed.\"],[\"There are not stretchy enough for my thick thighs as a gay male who performs In drag it didn't fit my thighs as I wanted too but it did fit my feet so I gave it up 3.\"],[\"Easier to walk in then expected, fits perfectly except for the top is a bit tight around calf.\"],[\"order one size larger there amazing and great for clubbing\"],[\"Kinda ivory white..Not purest white I expected. Nice shape boot. Small in calf area l could have done  size larger but I squeeze into them.\"],[\"I am a size 12 mens... so according to all the reading I have done, I'm supposed to order women's boots 2 sizes larger.  When I ordered these, I got a 15... and I probably could wear a 16.  So...  these things run pretty small.  They will be used for a costume getup (no, it's not a drag outfit!).\\n\\nAnother thing I quickly discovered... maybe this is just because I have never worn knee high boots or heels of any kind before...  but when you stand flat and do not move, the \\\"plane\\\" of the bottom of the boot is wrong.  First, the toe plate... it's not so much curved as it is a slight \\\"V\\\" shape.  It is possible to stand on your toes, simply by leaning forward and shifting your weight a little.  When you lean back again, the heel comes back down to the ground and your toes roll up a little.  This may be difficult to imagine, and again, it may just be because I have not worn heels before.  But it seems like it should have a flatter sole.\\n\\nThe 'patent leather' is VERY thin.  Not that I expected much, it's a $50 boot, not a $500 one.  In a way this is good because it stretches to stay tight around my huge calves.\\n\\nI can tell it's going to take a while to get used to walking in them, but I'll get comfortable with them in time.\\n\\nEDIT:  I ordered a 16 and it fits better.  So... 4 sizes larger than my men's size rating.\"],[\"Very sexy and excellent fit.  This is my second pair because I wore out the first ones !  A must buy !\"],[\"I'm normally a 6.5 shoe size, so I ordered a 7. My foot fit perfectly at the base, but then my calves (which at their widest are slightly smaller than 14\\\"), didn't fit. The size 7 boots wouldn't zip up past them! They look great, but it's too bad they don't fit. I'm rating them 3 stars because this is the first time any boots have never fit over my calves.\"],[\"awesome\"],[\"Not happy at all this ring looked very good in the pictures, however when I received it was I so disapointed.\"],[\"I gave it a 3 rating because I've had the ring for a few months now and now the stone looks worn out.  I absolutely LOVED this ring at first but now it's egh... alright.\"],[\"Gem i shinny. It is real silver. I am allergic to anything other then silver. The Gem is a little over sized for the band but overall it is very pretty. I ordered it and it actually arrived earlier then the date they estimated.\"],[\"The only con to this ring is that the prongs were a little miss aligned. And other were some small scratches next to mounting.\\nPros - .925 and it seems like a good sturdy ring, and the CZ is clear and exceeded expectations\"],[\"Exactly what I was hoping for. The Cubic Zirconia is sparkly and the perfect size. Fits accurately and the color is perfect Sterling Silver. The only thing that made me a bit sad was the band, which got marked up a little somehow, either in warehouse or during transit, but luckily it's not enough to make me fuss, plus for the price, if need be I could replace it at some point rather than return it for shipping costs that are pricier.\"],[\"I love this ring. My wedding band is gold but I wear a lot of silver jewelry and wanted something to match without spending a fortune. This is perfect. It matches my wedding ring and is absolutely beautiful. Super product, super price and super fast shipping. I couldn't be any happier.\"],[\"The ring looked foggy and not clear.  I wore it for two day's and took it off.  I'll probably replace the stone with a better one because the setting was sterling silver.\"],[\"I bought the 3-pack of black v-neck CK's via Amazon in May'09.  I purchased men's size \\\"Medium\\\" based on the fact that I bought the same 3-pack last year in size \\\"Large\\\" and the fit was bigger than I wanted.  I am 5'10\\\", 195lbs and usually wear a size \\\"Large\\\" in most men's tops.\\n\\nIn terms of sizing I was looking for a fit that is slightly snug versus too baggy (as the Larges were for me) so now that I have the size Mediums they are working out much better for my preference (especially since I've noticed they also tend to stretch out a bit over time).  Bad news is I have 6 of these tshirts clogging up my dresser drawers now, good news is since I have the Medium and Large sizes I can gain a few pounds and I'm still good to go (beer me).\\n\\nI do agree with some other reviewers that CK tshirts do tend to be thin material and they aren't your typical stand alone t-shirt you can show off about town.  They are good tshirts under another piece of clothing, as pajama top, or working around the yard.  I actually like the fact that CK v-necks are thin because they are very comfortable to wear for incognito usage.\\n\\nStyle-wise a good looking t-shirt with nice looking v-neck shape.\\n\\nOverall: 4 out of 5 stars. High marks for looks and comfort for my intended usage, minus 1 star for the slightly strange sizing causing inventory buildup in my dresser drawers.\\n\\nI hope you found my review helpful.\"],[\"About description is not good\"],[\"very satisfied with my purchase\"],[\"The logo is printed on the shirt now.

He's all around a huge guy (height, weight, and his shoulders) and while he normally wears XLs, sometimes they fit too tight on him due to his shoulders and neck.

Fabric is nice cotton.  I am 6' and 160lbs.  I wear a form fitting pilot uniform shirt over this t-shirt.  No issues.\\nI would buy this product again.  No issue with length.  If you have an exceptionally long torso there might be but if you are normal not issues.\"],[\"The length is really good, these shirts are perfect for wearing under button up shirts. They have a long enough tail to stay tucked in through hours of sitting at a desk, even through jumping up every time the boss calls. The material is thin enough to feel like it will last while not being too thick to be able to tuck in with another shirt over. Will definitely order more.\"],[\"Soft, long and stays black after many washes.\"],[\"Pretty good\"],[\"good\"],[\"fit well. accetable quality\"],[\"Great products in terms of quality and price.\"],[\"I have worn CKs for years and swear by the brand.

I'm happy with them though.\"],[\"Been wearing the Calvin Klein t-shirts for years and love them!  They fit as expected, don't stretch out OR shrink, are durable, and for some reson stay very white!  The V-Necks are great to layer with or wear alone!\"],[\"I love CK t-shirts. They are very soft and comfortable. It is hard to determine if the size is \\\"true.\\\" With vanity sizing these days, every brand seems to be different. I typically wear an XL in most brands (6'0\\\" tall and 215 lbs - 44R suit size). I usually get XL to compensate for my beer belly, but these were quit large and baggy for me personally with my dimensions. I then ordered size Large because they were such a great price and find that they fit much better. Still roomy enough not to grip my belly too much and fit my frame much better. The V-Neck helps draw attention away from that awful looking beer gut. Further, the length is great as I am fairly tall in the torso and have a problem with most brands because they are not long enough. They did not shrink on the initial two washes\\u002fdries, but in my past experience with CK t-shirts, after repeated washing\\u002fdrying they do tend to shrink a bit and lose their softness (around 1 year of use) - which is probably typical of most all brands and the repeated abuse of machine washing and high heat drying.\"],[\"Every thing was received as I expected. Very good service and good price\"],[\"buy for friend\"],[\"Great material but too large!\"],[\"good\"],[\"i love it, good product\"],[\"Product is fine, sizing is not consistent with other CK shirts I have bought.

Get one size larger.\"],[\"very good thank you\"],[\"Best T-Shirts ever\"],[\"I bought these for my boyfriend and the medium size fits him quite well in the shoulders but is a lot longer than anticipated (he is 5' 11.5\\\").  He likes his t-shirts longer though so it was a good purchase.  The fabric is nice and they wash well.\"],[\"Great Feel & Comfortable !\"],[\"great\"],[\"The shirts almost fit perfect. For some reason the sleeves are a bit shorter than I would like. This causes the sleeves to ride up and the need to pull them back down a must several times. Cotton is good quality holding up to multiple washings.\"],[\"I bought medium sized, I'm a 5'10 with a size 29 waist and thought it would fit me perfectly. The other reviews were right, the shirt is a bit of a tall fit and it felt like i was wearing a large shirt so i ended up giving the medium sized to my brother.\\nI ordered small the same day and it just came in and i was definitely more pleased with it, since i like to wear shirts that are less baggy.\\nDefinitely try to buy the smaller size if you are skinny and don't like baggy shirts\"],[\"Soft, and no tags.

These are top quality.  Some reviews state they run big, fit me perfectly.  I prefer roomy fit as they will shrink after a number of washes.

Never had a issue with the quality of the shirts.\"],[\"I bought this on sale and this is one of the best purchase I ever made on Amazon!  The shirt is 100% cotton so it's very soft, not too thick and not too thin.  The quality is just perfect!  Also, I'm glad that I didn't listen to most Amazon reviewers, the size is as advertised, it is not running large.\"],[\"good\"],[\"a little large but very soft and comfortable.\"],[\"I liked a lot these t-shirts... they are very confortable and fit very well in the body.\"],[\"Nice to wear under dark shirts and can pass as a polo shirt in a pinch. Very good construction and stitching, which is appreciated as some off brands (with lower prices) can't stand the test of time or multiple washes. In the end quality is less expensive, as you don't have to replace shirts as often, due to separated seams or fraying at the V point in the shirt.\"],[\"they are larger than a usual L\"],[\"Nice product,worth the price\"],[\"Buenisimas\"],[\"Tese shirts are so soft and comfortable.

Perfect\"],[\"I buy three V necks to wear around the house every year. Last year I bought these shirts in Large and White. They were a bit bigger than I wanted and got dirty quickly. This year I bought Medium and Black. The fit is great; not too tight in the stomach area or shoulders. I am average build and wear a 42 long suit coat. These shirts are great. Hopefully they do not fade too much from weekly washing.

Does not seem as Calvin Klein product\"],[\"Good T-shirts\"],[\"2 sizes bigger than usual\"],[\"I've only worn them once after they've gone through the wash and dryer.  They don't fit tight like some of the stretch Calvin Klein or similar v-neck I've been looking for but they are definitely quality and are what I was expecting to buy.  Calvin Klein also makes the best boxer briefs I own.  Would recommend.\"],[\"I purchased the same T's from Macy's which were made in Haiti and they were twice as thick. These are made in Bangladesh.

It fit him a lot, and very cool for summer.\"],[\"at first, I lost my mind and ordered large.. duh, so my neighbor won the lotto for new, super nice, soft t-shirts.. so I re=ordered and the xl is the perfect size.\\n\\nI have matching white leggins so I dyed all 3 a different color, so I have 'outfits' that all match.. love the fit and the SOFT!!\\n\\nthanks!\"],[\"Many t-shirts are thin and flimsy or at the other end, too heavy. These are just right and the quality overall is excellent.\"],[\"I've ordered this shirt pack twice. The first order was in early 2014, then again on June 4th, 2014. The shirts in the first order were correctly sized while in the second order they were much bigger. The cause of this is probably because of a change in manufacturing location that could be seen on the shirt collar. The shirts in the first order were made in Haiti while the second order was made in Bangladesh.\"],[\"Can't beat the price for CKlein T's  on Amazon, not as soft as older versions but very durable.

I must have tried different standard white v-necks as one medium seems to fit a lot tighter (which is desired for an undershirt) than others. I bought another two sets from Marshalls and they appeared to be the exact same product but fit a lot looser. They are very comfortable and I kept both.\"],[\"I am long in the torso and this T-shirt is shorter than size large by some other brands.  It's too skimpy for me but if it were 2\\\" longer, I'd buy more because otherwise it's a good shirt.\"],[\"The Shirts are a great fit. No doubt about that. However, I feel they are not very durable. It might get worn out soon. However, I will have to wait and see that.\"],[\"as a Chinese,it's too wider for me,but the length is ok,just not my type. So if you're a big man,it's for you.\"],[\"I think it's a good idea to spend more money on things that you use all the time.

A little long at first, but I know from experience they'll shrink a little to a perfect fit..\"],[\"Performs as advertised. It's freaking underwear - you buy the right size and it fits. What more can be said?\"],[\"Great undershirt to consider making part of your wardrobe, that doesn't fade too quickly (too yellow, that is) and does not cost you an arm and leg for something that's considered a basic-necessity in a civilized world.\"],[\"These shirts are luxuriously soft. The fabric is a little thin, but I live in a warm climate and only wear them as undershirts. They are much softer than the Hanes shirts I bought recently. I will buy only these from now on.\"],[\"I took these out of the package and they seemed to be a few inches too long and about an inch too wide. I put them through the wash on a warm cycle and they came out fitting exactly as a medium should fit.\"],[\"These undershirts are a must have for any man who likes comfort and that clean feeling. my husband is very particular about his under clothes and these are great. the material is soft and it fits just right\"],[\"Nice shirts, nice quality but I wish I hadn't listened to the reviews that said the shirts run large. I normally wear a large but I ordered size medium based on reviews that advised me to do so. Well, I need a size Large. I'll be ordering more in my actual size.\"],[\"I love these V neck shirts.

Other than that, it was a great buy.\\nIf I had received colors ordered, I would rate 5 stars.\"],[\"I bought these as undershirts to wear under a dress shirt and tucked into dress pants or khakis.\\n\\nAfter a couple washes these shrunk in length and now I have the annoying problem of the shirt becoming untucked or wrinkled up at my belt line.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a casual v-neck to wear untucked with jeans or whathaveyou, these might do the trick.  As an undershirt, I will stick with the the Dockers V-necks.\"],[\"It is too large to wearI will wear it when I sleepI buy it for it named CK, whatever ,....\"],[\"Nice fabric, very fresh, however does seems to run a little big. I order a medium being a 6ft guy however next time (there will be a next time) i'm buying them small\"],[\"I got 3 of these sets and I really regret it. They were much longer than expected.

So glad I found them on Amazon.  Smooth, comfortable and good fit.\"],[\"These are excellent shirts. They are definitely for under clothing wear. The quality of the fabric and construction far outshine anything I've purchased in the last 15 years. Do yourself a favor. Buy them.

Very pleased.\"],[\"Fabrics in general, does not work fine! T-shirt tailoring is also very general. Only worth the price, cost is not high\"],[\"The vnecks are of quality.

They wash great, hold their color and always fit perfectly. We tried other more expensive brands but he won't wear them because they didn't feel as good and the v-neck was deeper and looked sloppier. Learned my lesson- only buy Calvin Klein.\"],[\"I ordered these as undershirts because I already had white V-neck Calvin Klein shirt that fits very well, and I thought these were the same.  My previously owned short fit nice and snugly across the shoulders as well as through the body.  I wanted the same fit so that the undershirts wouldn't bunch up at the waist under my dress shirts.  These shorts are nice and thin, comfortable and fit like a large across the shoulders, but I think an undershirt should fit tighter through the body than a normal t-shirt.  I must need an \\\"athletic fit\\\" undershirt, but am having trouble finding one.\"],[\"These shirts run on the large side. Very soft, comfortable fit. Great for underneath a button up or plain with jeans.\"],[\"the buy was delayed, I usually get the same size, but this I had something big, the model and the quality is all right, it is a pity he did not get the size that i wanted\"],[\"I got 2 of these sets and I really regret it.

Very disappointed that amazon does not clearly state that.\"],[\"I'll be honest, I'm a fashion geek who often buys name brands just because I can feel confident that I look good in them.  There is something about Calvin Klein underwear that just fits and feels great.  I don't know what it is, but I'm a confirmed buyer.  Very reasonably priced, extremely prompt shipment, I would buy from this seller anytime.\"],[\"I normally wear snug fitted medium shirts. I have an athletic build. Not jacked. Just..athletic. These fit..casually. I will purchase more.\"],[\"Update:\\n\\nI'm about to place my 3rd order of these shirts. I ordered 9 over one year ago, and 9 one year prior to that. I am one of those guys who just sweats a lot. To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.\\n\\nOLDER Revew:\\nI wear white undershirts every day to extend the life of my expensive collard shirts. These guys soak up my sweat, and wash very easy. They also have delivered on being white for longer than quite a few other shirts I have owned before them. I'll be reordering more of these when they wear out, but for now, they're holding up quite well.\"],[\"I just received the skillet because I was away for the holidays.  In about ten minutes I will be checking out its cooking characteristics\"],[\"The shoulders are fine but it is too long. So I need resize it. The quality is somewhat cheap. But worth the price.\"],[\"love the fit and feel, and he looked great in these shirts! the size was a perfect fit for my sons frame.\"],[\"i love it\"],[\"very satisfacyory..g good that when i see tne name calvin klein  i almost get an emotional breakdown have a happy holiday\"],[\"If you're like me, some shirts can make you feel like you're being choked by a really weak guy (thank you Mitch Hedberg). These shirts will eliminate that problem, unless you're really being choked by a weak guy. Quality cotton as opposed to the crap cotton available on all cheap t-shirts (fruit of the loom). These feel good and look good.\"],[\"Very nice quality cotton T-shirt! So far it does not shrink up after drying, I just dry them on a  lower setting.\"],[\"These look good, they fit well, and the material is nicer than other undershirts. Its thinner and doesn't wrinkle and bunch up under a shirt. Also, the V-neck solves one of those manly problems. You don't want to wear a white t-shirt under a black shirt, but wearing a black shirt under a dress shirt usually means Ozzy Osbourne's face is peeking out.\"],[\"Material is very thin for a shirt to look good, and also they are very long...so the sign LG is probably XL..\"],[\"After receiving the shirts they were a little on the bulky side, however, after two washes they were down to just the right size that I wanted them to be at. The quality is very nice and they are quite soft.\"],[\"Great qualiy and it fit me better except the sheeves is a little bigger, vandeful shopping exparence, so good exparance.\"],[\"They last a long time with quality stitching at the shoulder. Over the years, they keep their form and stiffness unlike other t-shirts that get super thin.\"],[\"Calvin Klein infrequently makes their t-shirts available in different colors. I bought these because they are just that. I made the mistake several years ago thinking that they will always offer these shirts in various colors. I was wrong. Get these before they're no longer available.\"],[\"The size fits well around the chest and shoulders but the Tshirt is too long. Will need to order the slim fit style next time.\"],[\"I love these V-necks, they are extremely comfortable and will shrink only a minimal amount when washed with cold water.\"],[\"Bought as a gift. My friend liked it, and they seem to look fine when i see him wearing them.\"],[\"The ideal v-neck undershirt for me.  Feels quality, just the right thickness, and my favorite aspect of the shirt is the cut of the v-neck.  It's not too deep nor too shallow; it follows the typical dress shirt neck perfectly with the top button unbuttoned.  No more seeing a gigantic V (like you do with a Hanes v-neck) under a white button-up dress shirt.\"],[\"Shrink a loooot after washing it for the first time, but it fits well The color is the exactly the same as on the picture. I like it.\"],[\"The shirts ran big. They did not shrink after washing and drying. My son always wears an XL but XL was way too big.\"],[\"These are my go to shirts for everything.  They are wonderfully soft and hold up forever.  Plus they hold their shape through 100's of wash and dry cycles!\"],[\"love them!  i wear the to the gym, to sleep in, to run to the market in.  They always fit and i really like these blue ones.  I normally get white.  Oh and by the way-I'm a 60+ woman and I look really cute in Calvin Klein T-Shirts.  ;-)\"],[\"I am finally getting the point, want t-shirts that don't shrink after 2 washes, then pay just a little more.  I am used to buying XL shirts counting on the shrink factor.  But was told these would be good as large and they are.  couple washed in so far, no shrinking.  they feel a little different at the front of the shoulder, but nothing I worry about.  I've worn these both as under-shirts and as primary shirt and they look good and work nice for both.\"],[\"I love the Calvin Klein V-Necks undershirts and always wished that they offered colors other than the black, white or gray. Glad I ran across these on amazon.\\n\\nThese shirts are soft and tagless. They fit exactly as expected. Hoorah for color!!\"],[\"Incredibly soft and a perfect fit.  Washed one time and held up nicely.  Didn't get the sense that there was any shrinkage of the fabric - size stayed consistent with pre-wash sizing.  Really good fit and comfortable.  Perfect for jeans of khaki shorts.  Just classic all around.\"],[\"I originally purchased this item from Nordstrom and loved it - it fit like a glove.  It fit so well that I could wear it as an undershirt or just by itself.  I bought this from Amazon thinking it was the exact same product, just $5 cheaper...big mistake.  The Amazon Calvin Klein v necks were poorly cut and very uncomfortable.  It was extremely tight in the chest and shoulders and very long and wide in the torso area, like I was wearing a muumuu.  They immediately felt like factory rejects (or maybe knock off CK's).  I wouldn't recommend purchasing any name brand T-shirts from Amazon.\"],[\"I bought some excellent fresh color shirts to my liking, which received timely, ie what I hoped and expected from this product, I'm happy with this purchase\"],[\"You really cant go wrong these V-neck shirts they fit great and are comfortable.

These shirts are light yet durable and the fabric is super soft.  He loves them!  The only difference between these and the old ones he has is that the fabric is a bit thinner now, but it isn't bad quality, just different.  The comfort is what matters most, in my opinion.  They also have a pleasantly flattering fit!\"],[\"My nephew has used them a lot since I bought them. the fabric is soft, the fit doesn't change with washing and they just look nice\"],[\"The Calvin Klein t-shirts are cut well, the length is long enough to stay tucked in, and they hold up very well.  Best t-shirts I have ever used.\"],[\"Probably will not buy again because after a few washing they tend to yellow. Cannot use chlorine bleach. I do not like \\\"dingy\\\" t-shirts.\"],[\"Very good t-shirt, medium weight cotton but suitable for wearing with or without a shirt that is buttoned or unbuttoned.  Colorfast despite several washings.\"],[\"I bought these for my husband. He wears white shirts all the time. I bought these for him. He loves them. They are light and comfortable.\"],[\"Got the 3 shirts, 1 had a weird issue with the neck hole skewing off to the side.\\nIt may have been mis-cut or mis-sewed, but whatever it is it looked bad.\\n\\nOnly 2 of the 3 shirts are worthwhile.\"],[\"These T-shirts are a great value. Have been buying them over the years and find they hold up much better than other brands. And purchased through Amazon, they are a great deal as well.\"],[\"As underwear or not, these are a staple of my wardrobe. A little slim fitting but perfect for my body type.\"],[\"Just fine, decent quality. just nothing to rave about. Jos. A. Bank's are better a bit thicker nicer wearing-last awhile.\"],[\"my husband absolutely love these shirts no more wet patch! Highly recommended to all men who wears business shirt on a daily basis.\"],[\"Looks nice.  Shrinks a bit.  I normally wear large size, but on the advice of another review I went with Medium.  Works well.  Have 6 of them now.\"],[\"i have been using this since the last six months just amazing the fabric is great soft and good fit\"],[\"good size, good fabric and arrived promptly. it's a slim fit, so it fits perfectly. would buy again fort sure\"],[\"Calvin Klein makes the best, reasonably affordable undergarments. And the price was right, until I found out how many sales calvinklein.com has!\"],[\"Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz Ao\"],[\"The packaging is intact and not damaged. The Asian fit to wear the minimum number clothes very personal, it is recommended that you buy!\"],[\"I have been wearing these for years because I like a light weight T shirt. If you are looking for a heavy T, this one is not for you.\"],[\"These shirts are longer than any other size medium shirts I've ever bought (the sleeves stuck out of my short sleeve shirt sleeves and I do not wear super fitted shirts).  Also, when they came, they were pink.  I looked at them in a lot of different lights, had other people look at them, compared to other shades of white.  It was weird. It went away after the first wash though and now they are a nice brilliant white.\"],[\"Same undershirts as at the mall for less money.  The brand I prefer.  Not sure what more needs to be said.\"],[\"Great fit and quality as promised in the description.  Neckline fits nicely and length fits deeply into pants so that it doesn't come loose.\"],[\"I have ordered a pack of these shirts before and they were exactly what I expected. This time however the material was just a bit thinner than before and the stitching was not quite as sturdy as before. Within the first couple wears of this product the stiching around the sleeve has already torn. The quality is just not the same as previous packs of this shirt that i have owned.\"],[\"They were a perfect fit on my boyfriend. Great birthday gift... he loved them;) I would definately buy them again!\"],[\"Its so good yes i love it i will prder it again nice to wear it its comftable on time\"],[\"the product that i buy is ok, is original, very good product, and the quality is very good, and im very satisfed with this buy\"],[\"I have tried all the other brands - Fruit of the loom, Hanes, DKNY etc and the CK shirts are the best quality, period.\"],[\"I purchased these T-shirts for my husband who is 5'10\\\" and weighs 175.  I bought a \\\"Medium\\\" based on the reviews about sizing which stated that they ran large.  These were the right size when I took them out of the package, but shrunk in width so much that my husband couldn't get them over his head.  I wouldn't buy these again because it would be impossible to choose the right size since they only shrunk in width not length.\"],[\"I have been wearing these CK v-necks as my primary white undershirt on weekdays or around-the-house weekend shirt for about 3 years now. Over that time I have probably purchased 6 or 7 packages, some through Amazon and some through other retailers. The first few I had no problem with, but after that, the length varied drastically with each new package I got. The variance between shortest and longest runs about 4 inches. Within a package, they are consistent, but not when comparing those from different packages. This is a problem when using under dress shirts, as the short ones can come untucked very easily and bunch above your pant waistband, or if wearing solo, you get to show off your stomach whenever you raise your hands above eye level. If you get a package and after a wash they seem shorter than they should be, exchange for a different package to try again.\\n\\nAside from length, the quality seems pretty consistent, though I've had a few sloppy \\\"lumpy\\\" shoulder seams now and again. For the price, you cannot complain too much for this.\"],[\"I`M 200lb,select size L but is too big for me. Maybe I should select size S for me. Amazon`s size guide is not accuracy.\"],[\"perfect fit! you can tell it was more expensive by the fabric and how it was tailored. came pretty quick. i have already ordered multiple times since the first time i bought a pack!\"],[\"Upon opening my order the shirts had an off white look to them. Looking closer they had a slight pink look to them.  I have washed with bleach twice and now they look light pink  To lazzy to deal with hassel of returning  so into the clean rag drawer they go\"],[\"Great quality shirts, they fit snug and are very soft.\\n\\nI bought it as a stocking stuffer and they can't stop raving about them. They want more more more!\\n\\nHave washed many times and they seem to hold their \\\"black\\\" well.\"],[\"got them right on time, the t shirts are thick enough to be worn by itself, the color is very solid, went just right on the size (medium, im 5'9 175 pounds)\"],[\"These shirts are definitely good quality, but the sizing is at least one full step (if not maybe a step and a half) larger than normal. I usually wear either a large or extra-large shirt (for comparison, an American Apparel crew t-shirt in a large fits me well but maybe a tad towards the small end of the range.) I bought these in a medium and not only do they fit, they're significantly looser than an American Apparel shirt in large. It seems like CK is doing some vanity sizing in their t-shirt line.\"],[\"I know the description says that these are t-shirts, but really they are undershirts... as in not the t-shirts you just wear on their own.\\n\\nSo to that end, they work well. They are thin, so that you are not wearing bulky layers of clothing. They are extra long, so that they stay tucked in. They are soft and comfy as well.\\n\\nI'm surprised that others say the shirts run big since I'm 5'5\\\" and 160 lbs, and I wear a medium... just like my regular shirts.\\n\\nThe only real gripe I have (besides the high price) is that there is a tag on the shoulder that itches me. There's no tag on the neck, presumably to prevent an itchy neck, but then they put the tag on the shoulder. Kinda lame, but no biggie.\"],[\"These seem to be good quality shirts.  The V is just the right depth, and the shirts are well-made with good material.  However, I ordered a Medium, and the size appears to be quite large.  I washed and dried them hoping that they would shrink . . . and they didn't.  If you're debating between two sizes, I suggest ordering the smaller one.\"],[\"I don't get the negative reviews here ... I wear undershirts every day under a dress shirt and this is the best v-neck I have found in awhile.  I find with most v-necks the collars suck - either way too deep and you see an imprint of a deep V under your dress shirt, or they have a thick collar that's too tight.  This is pretty close to just right - just low enough that you can't see it, but not so low that it's WAY under the neck line of your dress shirt (brooks bros iron free, top button left unbuttoned).\\n\\nYes the material is thin - I like that, it's an undershirt.  Material is soft and seems to be high quality.\"],[\"it's a little on the thin side but it would serve best as an undershirt, rather than as something that would stand alone!\"],[\"The shipping was very fast and on time. The price was also very reasonable.. but the quality of the t-shirts was not what I expected. I had to spend at least few minutes cutting the seams of the shirts. Also when I handwashed them for the first time, the black color bleeded alot. It doesn't bleed the second time but it does bleed alot on the first time. Only the quality of cotton is good. It seems very durable and it is actually pretty thick.\"],[\"The quality of these shirts are pretty good. They are soft and seem durable. The only problem I had was that they were way too long. I'm fairly short (5'7\\\"), and the mediums were about 6 inches below my beltline.\"],[\"At ~10 each these are not well made.  The material is thin with long loose strings on most seams and size is too big.  Dockers T-Shirts are a great deal at ~4 each--I only wish they came in black!\\n\\nNot sure if it matters but mine were made in Haiti.\"],[\"Well made, fit my hat nicely. I'll buy again in other colors.\"],[\"I switch out the band on my Panama Hat depending on what I'm wearing, and how dressy I want to be...black for dressy, colors for more casual.. These are very high quality, and easy to change. The average person never realizes you are wearing the same hat...only having one hatband for your hat makes about as much sense as having only one tie for your suit. And, at this price, you should have several!\"],[\"Like most hats, the crown of my hat tapers slightly. When I put the band on, it had a big gap along the top edge. Probably would be great for a stovepipe hat.\"],[\"The anchor hook came off the first one before I could get it on my husband's hat! The company immediately sent me another one. The second one went on without a problem. I recommend this company.\"],[\"Ok Quality.\"],[\"worked great! it was just what i wanted and the color was just right for my hat that i have!\"],[\"This is a nice hat band but we thought we ordered beige, which looked more brown in the picture and it actually is a greenish color.\"],[\"Too tall, but I folded down one pleat and it worked just fine.\"],[\"Exactly what we needed to replace another band that came with the hat.\"],[\"The band is tight on the hat and tends to pull it together.  I am trying to stretch it some.\"],[\"It was a perfect fit for my husband's Tilley's hat .  It looks very nice and stylish.\"],[\"This band did not work at all, it is not tapered. For me it was useless, i guess it may fit other hats.\"],[\"Too small does not fit like it should. In order to get the band to have the same width all the way across the front, the connectors have to mate at the back of the hat and not on the side as is traditional. Not worth the money. And,,,the band is much more green than it is Khaki. Pretty much a failure all around.\"],[\"Not fancy but nicely done. Easy to attach. Good deal\"],[\"once i figured out how to put it on the hat' i loved it, I especially liked that it can be used over another hat band if i wanted to.  I don't but nice to have the option.\"],[\"I got this to spice up an outback hat that I have and it doesn't quite fit it correctly. It does have built in pins at the ends to hold it in place, it could use a couple more along the length to make it more correctly fitted to a variety of hats.  I also got this in black, this one isn't quite as long as the black, and the inner end isn't as well put together on this one as the black one was.\"],[\"Nothing stretchy here. Had to dismantle it to make it work. Not worth the trouble. Save yourself the trouble and buy a ribbon and stapler. Same look.\"],[\"A nice hatband to dress up my favorite old hat. It dresses the hat up nicely. But pay attention, the attachment pins (actually hooks) are very sharp. In spite of knowing this, I managed to hook the heel of my hand...Dooh! It came in on time and was just as described.\"],[\"This was perfect! I didn't like the band on a fedora I bought my husband to wear for our wedding. Took the other off and put this on. Piece of cake! Lookd sharp!\"],[\"Met expectations\"],[\"Great product if you are going to have it tacked on by machine. The two pin clip system just did not work for me. snug on the bottom but space on top. the ribbon needed to be designed somewhat concave. I am keeping it because I am going to have it permanently attached by machine.\"],[\"Just what it was suppose to be.\"],[\"fast shipping and reasonable price.\"],[\"Adjustable but it is pleated and can get a bit sloppy looking as pleating can come unfolded.\"],[\"not what I excepted, keeps falling off\"],[\"This fits fine and it looks as good as the original one. I would recommend this to any one that is replacing one with a name on it\"],[\"it was just ok. quality was fine but the actual fitting it on the hat is not that easy. it doesnt just fit any hat. would be go to know which exact types beforehand.\"],[\"Don't waste your money on this product.  There are sharp prongs on either end of the band to push into the hat.  Poor quality cotton fabric, the hems are merely ironed over and come loose very easily.\"],[\"Was a little difficult trying to figure out how to put it on.  But once we got it on I really liked it.  Looks great on the hat.\"],[\"It's o.k.\"],[\"It works.  Fast delivery, no problems fitting it to a hat, especially if you can remove the old band first.\"],[\"Great seller! Received earlier than expected very nice quality.  Ordered another.\"],[\"Great hat band but I'm going to use it on a new olive green fedora.\"],[\"I hate it.  It may fit a small child's hat.\"],[\"This style of hat band is perfect for my Panama Jack straw hat.  The old hat band was faded and stained with perspiration.  Thirty seconds was all it took to remove the old band and install the new one.  It looks great now.\"],[\"Product is well made and looks good.  Unfortunately not quite what I was looking for.\"],[\"It fit as expected\"],[\"I got this to spice up an outback hat that I have and it doesn't quite fit it correctly. It does have built in pins at the ends to hold it in place, it could use a couple more along the length to make it more correctly fitted to a variety of hats.\"],[\"Concerned with fit.\"],[\"Not ironed properly. Disappointed in condition!\"],[\"Had shorten  one inch From hat band ,Looking good.\"],[\"Great product if you are going to have it tacked on by machine.

It was just kind of dorky looking and a little sloppy in fit, so we returned it.\"],[\"I live in Denver and am outside all day in the summer, I have yet to get burnt on my face and neck.\"],[\"The fit is fine but the neck flap is very rigid and thick, Ventilation is pretty good but the flap is very stiff.\"],[\"It's a sturdy hat.  I noticed that the adjustment cord hits the flap which can be kind of (irritating) noisy.  Not sure what the hook on the back is for.\"],[\"I was able to find buy and receive these socks quickly. They were perfect for our costumes and good quality for a good price.\"],[\"A little flimsy but they are very pretty. I've hesitated to wear them too often because I don't want to have to replace them too soon.\"],[\"Very very cheaply made, not worth it in the least. It came in a tight package and it is hard to unwrinkle the ruffles\"],[\"They're very durable, cute, and precious looking. I have size 10 feet and was worried these wouldn't fit, but they do ~ The only thing I don't like is that the lace isn't the neatest, like they sew the lace  around the top of the sock and instead of sewing the end and beginning of the lace together, they overlap the lace and then just cut. I put a little bit of clear nail polish over the cut of the lace to stop it from unraveling.\"],[\"My socks came very quickly. I like how they feel. I like the ribbon of lace at the top of the sock. They are very comfortable.\"],[\"fabric is a bit synthetic, but i knew it would be. otherwise love these things and wear them all the time. wash easy. comfortable. sessy and fancy.\"],[\"Great fun socks to wear with a summer dress.  Adds pizzaz.  Love em.\"],[\"Just what I needed for a party\"],[\"Worked perfect for my and my bridesmaid's wedding socks!

Great price and they arrived on time for my Halloween party!\"],[\"Cheap frilly socks, that fit and got here on time. woo!\"],[\"Very cute & good quality\"],[\"I ordered these lace socks for my Dorothy costume - they are perfect!\"],[\"These are perfect for a porcelain doll costume I'm putting together. They add a little touch of girlish femininity to the whole thing. I have pretty small feet (size 5.5), but these fit perfectly and seem like they could stretch to accommodate most sizes. It's kind of a thick pantyhose material, so I'm not sure how long they'll last but they're great for now!\"],[\"Washed several times, holding up well. I never put in dryer.\"],[\"Very nice\"],[\"Super cute and the lace ruffle is wide so you can really see them!\"],[\"told that they were great\"],[\"These socks are super comfy. Showed up on time.

Not really worth it in my opinion..\"],[\"very cute for my 50\\\"s costume\"],[\"Went great with my outfit. Although they are sheer, they did not rip or have a run in them.\"],[\"Very nice and so cute.\"],[\"Good fit and good quality. Fast shipping also.\"],[\"Cute\"],[\"Very comfortable, elegant socks... Thin (comfy) material\"],[\"I'm conflicted. I wrote a review but feel like I was just a bit too harsh. These would work best with a Halloween costume, not for everyday use with cute outfits. Because, they do look costume-y. But for 5 dollars... they are a good deal. Especially if it is for a costume, or you just wanna add another pair to your collection. I would recommend these, just because of the low price. It can't hurt to buy them. They may not be my favorite pair but I will surely still use them occasionally. However they did fit me nicely and I wear a size 8 1\\u002f2. I feel like they would fit a few sizes larger than me as well.\"],[\"They're so cute, especially if you pull them up a bit to wear with short boots.\"],[\"Very cute socks! Fit my size 10 feet perfectly and are even a little longer than I expected having bigger feet! Very cute with any shoes (I love them with these black Mary Janes).

Needed for a Halloween costume.\"],[\"Cute, cute for my Halloween costume this year.\"],[\"Perfect for my Halloween costume!\"],[\"Great and cheap\"],[\"Cheap rip\"],[\"fun socks!\"],[\"These had strings out of the seems on the lace part and lots of manufacturing issues. If you stretch them to fit over your foot it will destroy the sowing and the lace will come apart. The lace that wraps around the ankle isn't hemmed where the fabric ends in the back, so it won't make it through the wash.\"],[\"worked well for a retro shoot\"],[\"Super cute,  I used them for a 80's themed party they were a little thin but great\"],[\":)\"],[\"I needed these socks for a costume and honestly these were pretty chintzy lace trimmed socks.  However, for the price and one time wear, it was fine.  Not sure when or where you would ever wear these and the lace fell apart after a wash.  Would I buy them again?  Most likely not.\"],[\"Ran small.  Very thin.  Color from everything transfered to these\"],[\"HOT, FUN\"],[\"This is your standard Halloween costume material and durability. Did the job for what it was intended and its adorable.\"],[\"These socks are nylon with lace top and they're soft and stretchy.\"],[\"cute\"],[\"I wear a size 7 and these fit perfectly.

Fit wonderful and she loves how these feel on her feet!!! Would buy again and again!\"],[\"The frilly part is quite poorly made but when you see them from a distance, they are so cute. And it does look like the picture.\"],[\"Using for a Halloween Costume\"],[\"I have a size 5 (US) Foot. This sock served its purpose as a Halloween costume- 1 time use. It was a bit large for me. I had a little extra fabric at the heel. I assume this is because I have a somewhat smaller than average foot size. I think if you are a 6 or higher you should be fine.\"],[\"Got this for a costume (Dorthy from Wizard of Oz) for my daughter and it looked perfect!\"],[\"Didn't order, must have hit by mistake, had to send it back.\"],[\"I bought these for a Halloween costume and for that purpose, they worked just fine. The foot is made out tights-like material and slips on easily. The ruffle is pretty, but oddly doesn't actually make a full circle- it just kind of overlaps at a random point and the ends aren't even finished, so it's a little bit scraggly. I guess that the nylon-style foot led to some sweating, because the bottoms made the dye from the inside of my shoes absorb into the sock- I washed them, but now the bottoms are blue. The shoes were cheap costume shoes, so I can't really blame that on the sock, but if you want the bottoms to stay white, beware colorful shoes. I thought I might wear them with ankle boots in a non-costume outfit, but they kept sort of slinking into my boot and with the scraggly edges, I wasn't crazy about looking like my feet were unraveling all day. I give them three stars, but I would just buy them if you have a one-night costume need and then toss them.\"],[\"The product is just okay for me, it would have been perfect if the whole socks were made of lace\"],[\"I already had a pair of these that I have owned for over ten years and are still in great shape, and decided to get a couple more to go with some Mary Jane shoes I bought.  They fit nicely, the ruffle is super pretty and holds up after many washings.  Unlike other ruffled ankle socks, the lace stays crisp and the nylon sock does not stretch out of shape and fall down.

The three pair are serving well alongside their far more expensive drawer-mates. It's hard to imagine someone getting excited by a pair of socks, but these are worth getting excited about. I agree that a color other than gray would help to stretch these socks further in my wardrobe, but for the price... I ain't complainin'!\"],[\"My first review but I have to say......About 15 years ago I developed an allergy to nickle (earrings, necklaces, belt buckles, buttons, bracelets!) and stopped wearing most jewelry. I have to tape over my belt buckles or any metal that contacts my skin and was diagnosed as severely allergic by my doc after allergy skin test. About a year ago I got my ears repierced with my daughter so we could have fun wearing jewelry and have tried every kind of hypo allergenic earring I could find: Studex, Sterling Silver 925, Surgical Steel, 14k gold, and had allergic reactions to all of them if worn for even an hour. Studex that my ears were pierced with was the worst! Bleeding, red itchy swollen earlobes a few weeks to heal in between each time I wore earrings! Searched Amazon for an hour to find these and did some research. They work as promised! I had to force them through (holes had partially closed) and had some initial healing for about 2 weeks. Now I'm wearing them 24\\u002f7 no problems! It's a first and really wonderful. I will get more. This size is a bit small for a main earring so I will get the next size up. THANK YOU.\"],[\"It is refreshing to wear these earrings because they don't make my earlobes swell up. My ears are too sensitive for \\\"sensitive\\\" earrings and I was about ready to give up and resign myself to clip earrings. Fortunately I found these. They are more expensive than other earrings due to the metal, but well worth it. It's like my ears don't even know they're there :) .\"],[\"I just got these a few weeks ago (along with a pair of titanium hoops) and love them. I haven't been able to wear earrings for years because of nickel allergies, and these earrings haven't given me any trouble whatsoever!\"],[\"these are the only earrings that have not caused an allergic reaction and they are very pretty too.\"],[\"I have only owned these earrings a few weeks, but I'm quite pleased with them.  Before buying these, I had been completely unable to wear earrings for many years.  My earlobes would swell, turn red, and bleed immediately after inserting even \\\"hypoallergenic\\\" earrings.  I've tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn't wear them.  I'd given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn't bought or tried any earrings for a few years.\\n\\nWhen these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven't bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.\\n\\nI noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.\\n\\nI highly recommend these for people with metal allergies - I'm planning to get another pair.\"],[\"The Suspenders are fine except one of the tongues or the buckles was put it the wrong way and the fastening of this one is not as secure as the correct buckle and the tongue sticks awkwardly out. I will have to take it to a leather shop to have the problem fixed. Other than that product is fine.\"],[\"These leather suspenders I highly recomend. They are simple, and compfortable. Easy to adjust. Look great!\"],[\"I have worn suspenders for quite a few years.  It is nice to buy a pair that really feels solid and comfortable.  From the construction to the materials used, I am impressed.  They look good in casual dress or on my jeans and really stand up to a hard days work.\"],[\"Actually I didn't buy them as liner gloves. I was looking for a light weight glove with some flexibility and durability. These fit the bill. They are perfect for dog walking in moderate winter weather. Fingers are a little short but they still work.\"],[\"1.13.12 UPDATE: I've now been using these gloves through all of December and half of January and I continue to recommend them. Many of my runs have taken place in temperatures within the 20s, and while the gloves are not winter gloves, they are working out. My hands are cold as I start my run and the tips of my fingers do sting initially, but after about half a mile or a mile, I've warmed up enough that my hands become comfortable. In fact, I think if I were wearing anything heavier, the warmth of the gloves might become too much. These allow me to go for 8-mile runs without feeling like I have to take them off. As long as you're okay starting your run with slightly cold hands, these could be for you.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using these gloves on and off for about a month now, and so far I've found them to be a great purchase. I usually go for runs around 5 a.m., and this has allowed me to test them out in temps that have resided in the mid-30s. So far, so good. They do the job. If I remember, I'll post an update once the weather gets even colder.\\n\\nMy only concern is the fit. I'm an average size guy, and there's something a little uncomfortable about the way they fit, as if the fingers could've been cut lower, that makes me think I'd have an issue with them if I were a taller guy with bigger hands. That being said, I'd purchase these again if I had to do it all over again. At this price point, you can't beat them.\"],[\"Had a pair of these for the past few years. same thing... great gloves for running and even short (1-2 hour long) bike rides in the cold.\"],[\"These gloves are good for running, but won't keep your hands warm if it's too windy. My only concern is about their durability. I've used them last winter for running (in Fayetteville, AR) and while traveling in Montana (Glacier and Yellowstone) during the end of Spring. The knits are starting to get loose, and I don't know how much longer they'll endure.\"],[\"Awesome gloves.  They're thin enough that you almost forget you have them on, but they're thick enough to keep my hands warm.  I'm in California so the coldest weather I have to run in is probably about 50 degrees.  Hard to beat at this price\"],[\"Good product, good transaction\"],[\"These are really pretty. I love Silver Forest earrings. Wish I could find merchants who honor their earring club.

I received several compliments on them when i wore them to work.  seller was prompt.  very satisfied with service.\"],[\"Over quite a few years I've bought and worn Silver Forest jewelry, especially earrings, and used to get so many compliments on them.  Unfortunately, their aesthetic has changed over time, away from what made their pieces special and interesting.  Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly \\\"pretty\\\" aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.  Such things are not bad, necessarily, but the variety is gone, and their pieces are just not very special anymore.  I'm very disappointed and will probably not seek out their products as I have over the years.  Too bad.\"],[\"Nice fun earrings good color. Not heavy or cheap looking.

They are very small and the \\\"turquoise\\\" background is actually plastic with a small piece of turquoise mounted to the metal (not silver). When I purchased these, they were advertised as sale priced from $40 to $18.  Now they're advertised at $13.50. These are not the quality I expected, and I won't be ordering jewelry again.\"],[\"received ear rings and very very happy with the quality, color and style.

I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart.  The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off.  They are useless now.  Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive.  The back of the earring is a flat separate piece of plastic and is not connected to the metal part of the earring so it flaps around.\\n\\nThese are cheap and fall apart quickly.\"],[\"So far I am very pleased with these less expensive versions of Birkenstocks.

Birkenstocks (and Betula's) are the best!\"],[\"I have been looking for this particular style of Birkenstock for over two years.  I already own a pair just like this and, unfortunately, they got wet so they don't look new anymore.  I was so happy to find them.  They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  I have flat feet and most shoes aren't very easy to wear for a very long period of time.  I can wear these all day and not only do my feet not hurt but my back doesn't either.

I would reccomend them to anyone for themselves or as presents for others.\"],[\"Wearing the same style Betulas purchased years ago (and they're still going strong!), I was so sure of my size that I ordered 3 new pairs in assorted colors. Well, no such luck. The footbeds of the \\\"new\\\" size 38's are slightly smaller than on my old sandals. My toes were hitting the edge of the footbed. Not comfortable at all. (I'm a size 7 in regular shoes).\\n\\nSo, I had to return them at my expense, and then pay the shipping to get the larger sized relacements sent to me.

When I ordered these, I got a 15... and I probably could wear a 16.  So...  these things run pretty small.  They will be used for a costume getup (no, it's not a drag outfit!).\\n\\nAnother thing I quickly discovered... maybe this is just because I have never worn knee high boots or heels of any kind before...  but when you stand flat and do not move, the \\\"plane\\\" of the bottom of the boot is wrong.  First, the toe plate... it's not so much curved as it is a slight \\\"V\\\" shape.  It is possible to stand on your toes, simply by leaning forward and shifting your weight a little.  When you lean back again, the heel comes back down to the ground and your toes roll up a little.  This may be difficult to imagine, and again, it may just be because I have not worn heels before.  But it seems like it should have a flatter sole.\\n\\nThe 'patent leather' is VERY thin.  Not that I expected much, it's a $50 boot, not a $500 one.  In a way this is good because it stretches to stay tight around my huge calves.\\n\\nI can tell it's going to take a while to get used to walking in them, but I'll get comfortable with them in time.\\n\\nEDIT:  I ordered a 16 and it fits better.

Super product, super price and super fast shipping. I couldn't be any happier.\"],[\"The ring looked foggy and not clear.  I wore it for two day's and took it off.  I'll probably replace the stone with a better one because the setting was sterling silver.\"],[\"I bought the 3-pack of black v-neck CK's via Amazon in May'09.  I purchased men's size \\\"Medium\\\" based on the fact that I bought the same 3-pack last year in size \\\"Large\\\" and the fit was bigger than I wanted.  I am 5'10\\\", 195lbs and usually wear a size \\\"Large\\\" in most men's tops.\\n\\nIn terms of sizing I was looking for a fit that is slightly snug versus too baggy (as the Larges were for me) so now that I have the size Mediums they are working out much better for my preference (especially since I've noticed they also tend to stretch out a bit over time).  Bad news is I have 6 of these tshirts clogging up my dresser drawers now, good news is since I have the Medium and Large sizes I can gain a few pounds and I'm still good to go (beer me).\\n\\nI do agree with some other reviewers that CK tshirts do tend to be thin material and they aren't your typical stand alone t-shirt you can show off about town.  They are good tshirts under another piece of clothing, as pajama top, or working around the yard.  I actually like the fact that CK v-necks are thin because they are very comfortable to wear for incognito usage.\\n\\nStyle-wise a good looking t-shirt with nice looking v-neck shape.\\n\\nOverall: 4 out of 5 stars. High marks for looks and comfort for my intended usage, minus 1 star for the slightly strange sizing causing inventory buildup in my dresser drawers.\\n\\nI hope you found my review helpful.\"],[\"About description is not good\"],[\"very satisfied with my purchase\"],[\"The logo is printed on the shirt now.

At first it was a little too big, but after the first wash\\u002fdry it shaped properly and fits perfectly now.\\n\\nThe material is thick, and it doesn't' feel cheap at all, while it is nice and soft and great for sleeping in too (your significant other will love the softness of the material!).\\n\\nWhen I purchased them, they were on sale and a great value - but even at regular price these shirts are definitely a great buy and can be worn as an every day shirt, as a black under shirt, or as a nice comfortable at home\\u002fnight shirt.  I have recommend these (and the white versions, as undershirts) to my friends and purchase new ones every so often when I lose them, or people take them!\\n\\nLastly, they are made to last! I have had some of these for more than a year (coming up on almost two years, actually) and they still look great and fit perfectly -- after about a year I usually retire them to night shirts and get new fresh ones (as I tend to stain them here and there and wear them so much that I like to purchase fresh ones to wear out -- don't don't let that make you think they don't last, I could absolutely still wear them out if I wanted to!).\\n\\nCalvin Klein is a great brand, and makes great V-Necks (in all colors!).\"],[\"The fabric is not good\"],[\"These shirts fit perfectly and are a great buy.\"],[\"To large for me\"],[\"Oversized and Overpriced.\\n\\nWorst packing for shipment ever.\"],[\"Great fabric and weight.

The V-Necks are great to layer with or wear alone!\"],[\"I love CK t-shirts. They are very soft and comfortable. It is hard to determine if the size is \\\"true.\\\" With vanity sizing these days, every brand seems to be different. I typically wear an XL in most brands (6'0\\\" tall and 215 lbs - 44R suit size). I usually get XL to compensate for my beer belly, but these were quit large and baggy for me personally with my dimensions. I then ordered size Large because they were such a great price and find that they fit much better. Still roomy enough not to grip my belly too much and fit my frame much better. The V-Neck helps draw attention away from that awful looking beer gut. Further, the length is great as I am fairly tall in the torso and have a problem with most brands because they are not long enough. They did not shrink on the initial two washes\\u002fdries, but in my past experience with CK t-shirts, after repeated washing\\u002fdrying they do tend to shrink a bit and lose their softness (around 1 year of use) - which is probably typical of most all brands and the repeated abuse of machine washing and high heat drying.\"],[\"Every thing was received as I expected.

Very good construction and stitching, which is appreciated as some off brands (with lower prices) can't stand the test of time or multiple washes.

I am pissed off!\"],[\"I have been searching for these at Macy's for a long time, but they don't have them anymore, this was a surprise, My husband loves these, great fit and great price! Great deal!!!\"],[\"Fine quality and fit.  Bought them for my husband to go along with pajama pants, and he really finds the material and fit comfortable for sleeping.  Good quality.\"],[\"Size was excellent, the quality was high, very comfortable in confusion.\\nCalvin Klein brand is well known and I would like to always wear this brand\"],[\"Calvin Klein undershirts are my husbands go to everyday shirt when he is working. They wash great, hold their color and always fit perfectly. We tried other more expensive brands but he won't wear them because they didn't feel as good and the v-neck was deeper and looked sloppier. Learned my lesson- only buy Calvin Klein.\"],[\"I ordered these as undershirts because I already had white V-neck Calvin Klein shirt that fits very well, and I thought these were the same.  My previously owned short fit nice and snugly across the shoulders as well as through the body.  I wanted the same fit so that the undershirts wouldn't bunch up at the waist under my dress shirts.  These shorts are nice and thin, comfortable and fit like a large across the shoulders, but I think an undershirt should fit tighter through the body than a normal t-shirt.  I must need an \\\"athletic fit\\\" undershirt, but am having trouble finding one.\"],[\"These shirts run on the large side. Very soft, comfortable fit. Great for underneath a button up or plain with jeans.\"],[\"the buy was delayed, I usually get the same size, but this I had something big, the model and the quality is all right, it is a pity he did not get the size that i wanted\"],[\"I got 2 of these sets and I really regret it.  They were much longer than expected.  It almost seems a 'tall' size.  Very disappointed that amazon does not clearly state that.\"],[\"I'll be honest, I'm a fashion geek who often buys name brands just because I can feel confident that I look good in them.  There is something about Calvin Klein underwear that just fits and feels great.  I don't know what it is, but I'm a confirmed buyer.  Very reasonably priced, extremely prompt shipment, I would buy from this seller anytime.\"],[\"I normally wear snug fitted medium shirts. I have an athletic build. Not jacked. Just..athletic. These fit..casually. I will purchase more.\"],[\"Update:\\n\\nI'm about to place my 3rd order of these shirts. I ordered 9 over one year ago, and 9 one year prior to that. I am one of those guys who just sweats a lot. To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.\\n\\nOLDER Revew:\\nI wear white undershirts every day to extend the life of my expensive collard shirts. These guys soak up my sweat, and wash very easy. They also have delivered on being white for longer than quite a few other shirts I have owned before them. I'll be reordering more of these when they wear out, but for now, they're holding up quite well.\"],[\"I just received the skillet because I was away for the holidays.  In about ten minutes I will be checking out its cooking characteristics\"],[\"The shoulders are fine but it is too long. So I need resize it. The quality is somewhat cheap. But worth the price.\"],[\"love the fit and feel, and he looked great in these shirts! the size was a perfect fit for my sons frame.\"],[\"i love it\"],[\"very satisfacyory..g good that when i see tne name calvin klein  i almost get an emotional breakdown have a happy holiday\"],[\"If you're like me, some shirts can make you feel like you're being choked by a really weak guy (thank you Mitch Hedberg). These shirts will eliminate that problem, unless you're really being choked by a weak guy. Quality cotton as opposed to the crap cotton available on all cheap t-shirts (fruit of the loom). These feel good and look good.\"],[\"Very nice quality cotton T-shirt! So far it does not shrink up after drying, I just dry them on a  lower setting.\"],[\"These look good, they fit well, and the material is nicer than other undershirts. Its thinner and doesn't wrinkle and bunch up under a shirt. Also, the V-neck solves one of those manly problems. You don't want to wear a white t-shirt under a black shirt, but wearing a black shirt under a dress shirt usually means Ozzy Osbourne's face is peeking out.\"],[\"Material is very thin for a shirt to look good, and also they are very long...so the sign LG is probably XL..\"],[\"After receiving the shirts they were a little on the bulky side, however, after two washes they were down to just the right size that I wanted them to be at. The quality is very nice and they are quite soft.\"],[\"Great qualiy and it fit me better except the sheeves is a little bigger, vandeful shopping exparence, so good exparance.\"],[\"They last a long time with quality stitching at the shoulder. Over the years, they keep their form and stiffness unlike other t-shirts that get super thin.\"],[\"Calvin Klein infrequently makes their t-shirts available in different colors. I bought these because they are just that. I made the mistake several years ago thinking that they will always offer these shirts in various colors. I was wrong. Get these before they're no longer available.\"],[\"The size fits well around the chest and shoulders but the Tshirt is too long. Will need to order the slim fit style next time.\"],[\"I love these V-necks, they are extremely comfortable and will shrink only a minimal amount when washed with cold water.\"],[\"Bought as a gift. My friend liked it, and they seem to look fine when i see him wearing them.\"],[\"The ideal v-neck undershirt for me.  Feels quality, just the right thickness, and my favorite aspect of the shirt is the cut of the v-neck.  It's not too deep nor too shallow; it follows the typical dress shirt neck perfectly with the top button unbuttoned.  No more seeing a gigantic V (like you do with a Hanes v-neck) under a white button-up dress shirt.\"],[\"Shrink a loooot after washing it for the first time, but it fits well The color is the exactly the same as on the picture. I like it.\"],[\"The shirts ran big. They did not shrink after washing and drying. My son always wears an XL but XL was way too big.\"],[\"These are my go to shirts for everything.  They are wonderfully soft and hold up forever.  Plus they hold their shape through 100's of wash and dry cycles!\"],[\"love them!  i wear the to the gym, to sleep in, to run to the market in.  They always fit and i really like these blue ones.  I normally get white.  Oh and by the way-I'm a 60+ woman and I look really cute in Calvin Klein T-Shirts.  ;-)\"],[\"I am finally getting the point, want t-shirts that don't shrink after 2 washes, then pay just a little more.  I am used to buying XL shirts counting on the shrink factor.  But was told these would be good as large and they are.  couple washed in so far, no shrinking.  they feel a little different at the front of the shoulder, but nothing I worry about.  I've worn these both as under-shirts and as primary shirt and they look good and work nice for both.\"],[\"I love the Calvin Klein V-Necks undershirts and always wished that they offered colors other than the black, white or gray. Glad I ran across these on amazon.\\n\\nThese shirts are soft and tagless. They fit exactly as expected. Hoorah for color!!\"],[\"Incredibly soft and a perfect fit.  Washed one time and held up nicely.  Didn't get the sense that there was any shrinkage of the fabric - size stayed consistent with pre-wash sizing.  Really good fit and comfortable.  Perfect for jeans of khaki shorts.  Just classic all around.\"],[\"I originally purchased this item from Nordstrom and loved it - it fit like a glove.  It fit so well that I could wear it as an undershirt or just by itself.  I bought this from Amazon thinking it was the exact same product, just $5 cheaper...big mistake.  The Amazon Calvin Klein v necks were poorly cut and very uncomfortable.  It was extremely tight in the chest and shoulders and very long and wide in the torso area, like I was wearing a muumuu.  They immediately felt like factory rejects (or maybe knock off CK's).  I wouldn't recommend purchasing any name brand T-shirts from Amazon.\"],[\"I bought some excellent fresh color shirts to my liking, which received timely, ie what I hoped and expected from this product, I'm happy with this purchase\"],[\"You really cant go wrong these V-neck shirts they fit great and are comfortable. Had no problems washing them at all\"],[\"Good buy. Regular fit. Order received as expected. Nice packaging. Good value for money. Would recommend this to others looking for basic white tshirt\"],[\"good quality, and l like it very much, it was so soft.\\nactually it was better as i expected, good.\"],[\"I like and really enjoy it this item. So defiitely I have to buy a new one. It is perfect.\"],[\"These T-Shirts fit really good. They are very soft and when washed they did not shrink! Not a bad price either. Would recommend!\"],[\"I ordered an XL as a gift but they fit small. So I inherited them. Nice to sleep in! Comfortable.\"],[\"this is a t-shirt. a white one. it's great. especaly for when you want to wear a white t-shirt. buy them if that's what you are looking for.\"],[\"I bought these shirts for my boyfriend who had purchased them for himself at another store a few years ago and liked them a lot.  These shirts are light yet durable and the fabric is super soft.  He loves them!  The only difference between these and the old ones he has is that the fabric is a bit thinner now, but it isn't bad quality, just different.  The comfort is what matters most, in my opinion.  They also have a pleasantly flattering fit!\"],[\"My nephew has used them a lot since I bought them. the fabric is soft, the fit doesn't change with washing and they just look nice\"],[\"The Calvin Klein t-shirts are cut well, the length is long enough to stay tucked in, and they hold up very well.  Best t-shirts I have ever used.\"],[\"Probably will not buy again because after a few washing they tend to yellow. Cannot use chlorine bleach. I do not like \\\"dingy\\\" t-shirts.\"],[\"Very good t-shirt, medium weight cotton but suitable for wearing with or without a shirt that is buttoned or unbuttoned.  Colorfast despite several washings.\"],[\"I bought these for my husband. He wears white shirts all the time. I bought these for him. He loves them. They are light and comfortable.\"],[\"Got the 3 shirts, 1 had a weird issue with the neck hole skewing off to the side.\\nIt may have been mis-cut or mis-sewed, but whatever it is it looked bad.\\n\\nOnly 2 of the 3 shirts are worthwhile.\"],[\"These T-shirts are a great value. Have been buying them over the years and find they hold up much better than other brands. And purchased through Amazon, they are a great deal as well.\"],[\"As underwear or not, these are a staple of my wardrobe. A little slim fitting but perfect for my body type.\"],[\"Just fine, decent quality. just nothing to rave about. Jos. A. Bank's are better a bit thicker nicer wearing-last awhile.\"],[\"my husband absolutely love these shirts no more wet patch! Highly recommended to all men who wears business shirt on a daily basis.\"],[\"Looks nice.  Shrinks a bit.  I normally wear large size, but on the advice of another review I went with Medium.  Works well.  Have 6 of them now.\"],[\"i have been using this since the last six months just amazing the fabric is great soft and good fit\"],[\"good size, good fabric and arrived promptly. it's a slim fit, so it fits perfectly. would buy again fort sure\"],[\"Calvin Klein makes the best, reasonably affordable undergarments. And the price was right, until I found out how many sales calvinklein.com has!\"],[\"Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz Ao\"],[\"The packaging is intact and not damaged. The Asian fit to wear the minimum number clothes very personal, it is recommended that you buy!\"],[\"I have been wearing these for years because I like a light weight T shirt. If you are looking for a heavy T, this one is not for you.\"],[\"These shirts are longer than any other size medium shirts I've ever bought (the sleeves stuck out of my short sleeve shirt sleeves and I do not wear super fitted shirts).  Also, when they came, they were pink.  I looked at them in a lot of different lights, had other people look at them, compared to other shades of white.  It was weird. It went away after the first wash though and now they are a nice brilliant white.\"],[\"Same undershirts as at the mall for less money.  The brand I prefer.  Not sure what more needs to be said.\"],[\"Great fit and quality as promised in the description.  Neckline fits nicely and length fits deeply into pants so that it doesn't come loose.\"],[\"I have ordered a pack of these shirts before and they were exactly what I expected. This time however the material was just a bit thinner than before and the stitching was not quite as sturdy as before. Within the first couple wears of this product the stiching around the sleeve has already torn. The quality is just not the same as previous packs of this shirt that i have owned.\"],[\"They were a perfect fit on my boyfriend. Great birthday gift... he loved them;) I would definately buy them again!\"],[\"Its so good yes i love it i will prder it again nice to wear it its comftable on time\"],[\"the product that i buy is ok, is original, very good product, and the quality is very good, and im very satisfed with this buy\"],[\"I have tried all the other brands - Fruit of the loom, Hanes, DKNY etc and the CK shirts are the best quality, period.\"],[\"I purchased these T-shirts for my husband who is 5'10\\\" and weighs 175.  I bought a \\\"Medium\\\" based on the reviews about sizing which stated that they ran large.  These were the right size when I took them out of the package, but shrunk in width so much that my husband couldn't get them over his head.  I wouldn't buy these again because it would be impossible to choose the right size since they only shrunk in width not length.\"],[\"I have been wearing these CK v-necks as my primary white undershirt on weekdays or around-the-house weekend shirt for about 3 years now. Over that time I have probably purchased 6 or 7 packages, some through Amazon and some through other retailers. The first few I had no problem with, but after that, the length varied drastically with each new package I got. The variance between shortest and longest runs about 4 inches. Within a package, they are consistent, but not when comparing those from different packages. This is a problem when using under dress shirts, as the short ones can come untucked very easily and bunch above your pant waistband, or if wearing solo, you get to show off your stomach whenever you raise your hands above eye level. If you get a package and after a wash they seem shorter than they should be, exchange for a different package to try again.\\n\\nAside from length, the quality seems pretty consistent, though I've had a few sloppy \\\"lumpy\\\" shoulder seams now and again. For the price, you cannot complain too much for this.\"],[\"I`M 200lb,select size L but is too big for me. Maybe I should select size S for me. Amazon`s size guide is not accuracy.\"],[\"perfect fit! you can tell it was more expensive by the fabric and how it was tailored. came pretty quick. i have already ordered multiple times since the first time i bought a pack!\"],[\"Upon opening my order the shirts had an off white look to them. Looking closer they had a slight pink look to them.  I have washed with bleach twice and now they look light pink  To lazzy to deal with hassel of returning  so into the clean rag drawer they go\"],[\"Great quality shirts, they fit snug and are very soft.\\n\\nI bought it as a stocking stuffer and they can't stop raving about them. They want more more more!\\n\\nHave washed many times and they seem to hold their \\\"black\\\" well.\"],[\"got them right on time, the t shirts are thick enough to be worn by itself, the color is very solid, went just right on the size (medium, im 5'9 175 pounds)\"],[\"These shirts are definitely good quality, but the sizing is at least one full step (if not maybe a step and a half) larger than normal. I usually wear either a large or extra-large shirt (for comparison, an American Apparel crew t-shirt in a large fits me well but maybe a tad towards the small end of the range.) I bought these in a medium and not only do they fit, they're significantly looser than an American Apparel shirt in large. It seems like CK is doing some vanity sizing in their t-shirt line.\"],[\"I know the description says that these are t-shirts, but really they are undershirts... as in not the t-shirts you just wear on their own.\\n\\nSo to that end, they work well. They are thin, so that you are not wearing bulky layers of clothing. They are extra long, so that they stay tucked in. They are soft and comfy as well.\\n\\nI'm surprised that others say the shirts run big since I'm 5'5\\\" and 160 lbs, and I wear a medium... just like my regular shirts.\\n\\nThe only real gripe I have (besides the high price) is that there is a tag on the shoulder that itches me. There's no tag on the neck, presumably to prevent an itchy neck, but then they put the tag on the shoulder. Kinda lame, but no biggie.\"],[\"These seem to be good quality shirts.  The V is just the right depth, and the shirts are well-made with good material.  However, I ordered a Medium, and the size appears to be quite large.  I washed and dried them hoping that they would shrink . . . and they didn't.  If you're debating between two sizes, I suggest ordering the smaller one.\"],[\"I don't get the negative reviews here ... I wear undershirts every day under a dress shirt and this is the best v-neck I have found in awhile.  I find with most v-necks the collars suck - either way too deep and you see an imprint of a deep V under your dress shirt, or they have a thick collar that's too tight.  This is pretty close to just right - just low enough that you can't see it, but not so low that it's WAY under the neck line of your dress shirt (brooks bros iron free, top button left unbuttoned).\\n\\nYes the material is thin - I like that, it's an undershirt.  Material is soft and seems to be high quality.\"],[\"it's a little on the thin side but it would serve best as an undershirt, rather than as something that would stand alone!\"],[\"The shipping was very fast and on time. The price was also very reasonable.. but the quality of the t-shirts was not what I expected. I had to spend at least few minutes cutting the seams of the shirts. Also when I handwashed them for the first time, the black color bleeded alot. It doesn't bleed the second time but it does bleed alot on the first time. Only the quality of cotton is good. It seems very durable and it is actually pretty thick.\"],[\"The quality of these shirts are pretty good. They are soft and seem durable. The only problem I had was that they were way too long. I'm fairly short (5'7\\\"), and the mediums were about 6 inches below my beltline.\"],[\"At ~10 each these are not well made.  The material is thin with long loose strings on most seams and size is too big.  Dockers T-Shirts are a great deal at ~4 each--I only wish they came in black!\\n\\nNot sure if it matters but mine were made in Haiti.\"],[\"Well made, fit my hat nicely. I'll buy again in other colors.\"],[\"I switch out the band on my Panama Hat depending on what I'm wearing, and how dressy I want to be...black for dressy, colors for more casual.. These are very high quality, and easy to change. The average person never realizes you are wearing the same hat...only having one hatband for your hat makes about as much sense as having only one tie for your suit. And, at this price, you should have several!\"],[\"Like most hats, the crown of my hat tapers slightly. When I put the band on, it had a big gap along the top edge. Probably would be great for a stovepipe hat.\"],[\"The anchor hook came off the first one before I could get it on my husband's hat! The company immediately sent me another one. The second one went on without a problem. I recommend this company.\"],[\"Ok Quality.\"],[\"worked great! it was just what i wanted and the color was just right for my hat that i have!\"],[\"This is a nice hat band but we thought we ordered beige, which looked more brown in the picture and it actually is a greenish color.\"],[\"Too tall, but I folded down one pleat and it worked just fine.\"],[\"Exactly what we needed to replace another band that came with the hat.\"],[\"The band is tight on the hat and tends to pull it together.  I am trying to stretch it some.\"],[\"It was a perfect fit for my husband's Tilley's hat .  It looks very nice and stylish.\"],[\"This band did not work at all, it is not tapered. For me it was useless, i guess it may fit other hats.\"],[\"Too small does not fit like it should. In order to get the band to have the same width all the way across the front, the connectors have to mate at the back of the hat and not on the side as is traditional. Not worth the money. And,,,the band is much more green than it is Khaki. Pretty much a failure all around.\"],[\"Not fancy but nicely done. Easy to attach. Good deal\"],[\"once i figured out how to put it on the hat' i loved it, I especially liked that it can be used over another hat band if i wanted to.  I don't but nice to have the option.\"],[\"I got this to spice up an outback hat that I have and it doesn't quite fit it correctly. It does have built in pins at the ends to hold it in place, it could use a couple more along the length to make it more correctly fitted to a variety of hats.  I also got this in black, this one isn't quite as long as the black, and the inner end isn't as well put together on this one as the black one was.\"],[\"Nothing stretchy here. Had to dismantle it to make it work. Not worth the trouble. Save yourself the trouble and buy a ribbon and stapler. Same look.\"],[\"A nice hatband to dress up my favorite old hat. It dresses the hat up nicely. But pay attention, the attachment pins (actually hooks) are very sharp. In spite of knowing this, I managed to hook the heel of my hand...Dooh! It came in on time and was just as described.\"],[\"This was perfect! I didn't like the band on a fedora I bought my husband to wear for our wedding. Took the other off and put this on. Piece of cake! Lookd sharp!\"],[\"Met expectations\"],[\"Great product if you are going to have it tacked on by machine. The two pin clip system just did not work for me. snug on the bottom but space on top. the ribbon needed to be designed somewhat concave. I am keeping it because I am going to have it permanently attached by machine.\"],[\"Just what it was suppose to be.\"],[\"fast shipping and reasonable price.\"],[\"Adjustable but it is pleated and can get a bit sloppy looking as pleating can come unfolded.\"],[\"not what I excepted, keeps falling off\"],[\"This fits fine and it looks as good as the original one. I would recommend this to any one that is replacing one with a name on it\"],[\"it was just ok. quality was fine but the actual fitting it on the hat is not that easy. it doesnt just fit any hat. would be go to know which exact types beforehand.\"],[\"Don't waste your money on this product.  There are sharp prongs on either end of the band to push into the hat.  Poor quality cotton fabric, the hems are merely ironed over and come loose very easily.\"],[\"Was a little difficult trying to figure out how to put it on.  But once we got it on I really liked it.  Looks great on the hat.\"],[\"It's o.k.\"],[\"It works.  Fast delivery, no problems fitting it to a hat, especially if you can remove the old band first.\"],[\"Great seller! Received earlier than expected very nice quality.  Ordered another.\"],[\"Great hat band but I'm going to use it on a new olive green fedora.\"],[\"I hate it.  It may fit a small child's hat.\"],[\"This style of hat band is perfect for my Panama Jack straw hat.  The old hat band was faded and stained with perspiration.  Thirty seconds was all it took to remove the old band and install the new one.  It looks great now.\"],[\"Product is well made and looks good.  Unfortunately not quite what I was looking for.\"],[\"It fit as expected\"],[\"I got this to spice up an outback hat that I have and it doesn't quite fit it correctly.

I've hesitated to wear them too often because I don't want to have to replace them too soon.\"],[\"Very very cheaply made, not worth it in the least. It came in a tight package and it is hard to unwrinkle the ruffles\"],[\"They're very durable, cute, and precious looking. I have size 10 feet and was worried these wouldn't fit, but they do ~ The only thing I don't like is that the lace isn't the neatest, like they sew the lace  around the top of the sock and instead of sewing the end and beginning of the lace together, they overlap the lace and then just cut. I put a little bit of clear nail polish over the cut of the lace to stop it from unraveling.\"],[\"My socks came very quickly. I like how they feel. I like the ribbon of lace at the top of the sock.

They fit perfect.\"],[\"perfect\"],[\"Honesty for the price you can't go wrong however you get what you pay for in that, they're cheap and don't really frill out like the picture they also come stuffed in a little package so they were wrinkly and I'm not sure you can iron them without melting the material..I would honestly just save the money. Not really worth it in my opinion..\"],[\"very cute for my 50\\\"s costume\"],[\"Went great with my outfit. Although they are sheer, they did not rip or have a run in them.\"],[\"Very nice and so cute.\"],[\"Good fit and good quality. Fast shipping also.\"],[\"Cute\"],[\"Very comfortable, elegant socks... Thin (comfy) material\"],[\"I'm conflicted. I wrote a review but feel like I was just a bit too harsh. These would work best with a Halloween costume, not for everyday use with cute outfits. Because, they do look costume-y. But for 5 dollars... they are a good deal. Especially if it is for a costume, or you just wanna add another pair to your collection. I would recommend these, just because of the low price. It can't hurt to buy them. They may not be my favorite pair but I will surely still use them occasionally. However they did fit me nicely and I wear a size 8 1\\u002f2. I feel like they would fit a few sizes larger than me as well.\"],[\"They're so cute, especially if you pull them up a bit to wear with short boots.\"],[\"Very cute socks! Fit my size 10 feet perfectly and are even a little longer than I expected having bigger feet! Very cute with any shoes (I love them with these black Mary Janes). So cute!\"],[\"Fun little socks despite the price being a little more than I would have hoped for such a simple sock.\"],[\"Cute and very comfortable. Needed for a Halloween costume.\"],[\"Cute, cute for my Halloween costume this year.\"],[\"Perfect for my Halloween costume!\"],[\"Great and cheap\"],[\"Cheap rip\"],[\"fun socks!\"],[\"These had strings out of the seems on the lace part and lots of manufacturing issues. If you stretch them to fit over your foot it will destroy the sowing and the lace will come apart. The lace that wraps around the ankle isn't hemmed where the fabric ends in the back, so it won't make it through the wash.\"],[\"worked well for a retro shoot\"],[\"Super cute,  I used them for a 80's themed party they were a little thin but great\"],[\":)\"],[\"I needed these socks for a costume and honestly these were pretty chintzy lace trimmed socks.  However, for the price and one time wear, it was fine.  Not sure when or where you would ever wear these and the lace fell apart after a wash.  Would I buy them again?  Most likely not.\"],[\"Ran small.  Very thin.  Color from everything transfered to these\"],[\"HOT, FUN\"],[\"This is your standard Halloween costume material and durability. Did the job for what it was intended and its adorable.\"],[\"These socks are nylon with lace top and they're soft and stretchy.\"],[\"cute\"],[\"I wear a size 7 and these fit perfectly. The material is more like thick tights so you get a form fit. I think this will fit women's shoe size 4-10 easily. Very Happy.\"],[\"Very cute and a good value.\"],[\"Gift for granddaughter. She said they fit just right and loves the look.\"],[\"Nice\"],[\"good\"],[\"Horrible cheap omg , my 7 yr old fits them\"],[\"Super cute socks. Reminds me of my childhood. I wear these with ankle booties.  I love how these look with dresses\"],[\"These are perfect with my vintage outfits!\"],[\"Super cute, arrived extremely fast!\"],[\"I really loved these socks, just wish the packaging came with more for the price!\"],[\"Cute retro socks. Great for swing club.\"],[\"Liked them alot\"],[\"These were awful no stretch.  I would not recommend unless you have really skinny ankles.\"],[\"too big for me (im size 7.5) :\\u002f\"],[\"So cute\"],[\"My wife loved this all because of the lace bit! Fit wonderful and she loves how these feel on her feet!!! Would buy again and again!\"],[\"The frilly part is quite poorly made but when you see them from a distance, they are so cute. And it does look like the picture.\"],[\"Using for a Halloween Costume\"],[\"I have a size 5 (US) Foot. This sock served its purpose as a Halloween costume- 1 time use. It was a bit large for me. I had a little extra fabric at the heel. I assume this is because I have a somewhat smaller than average foot size. I think if you are a 6 or higher you should be fine.\"],[\"Got this for a costume (Dorthy from Wizard of Oz) for my daughter and it looked perfect!\"],[\"Didn't order, must have hit by mistake, had to send it back.\"],[\"I bought these for a Halloween costume and for that purpose, they worked just fine. The foot is made out tights-like material and slips on easily. The ruffle is pretty, but oddly doesn't actually make a full circle- it just kind of overlaps at a random point and the ends aren't even finished, so it's a little bit scraggly. I guess that the nylon-style foot led to some sweating, because the bottoms made the dye from the inside of my shoes absorb into the sock- I washed them, but now the bottoms are blue. The shoes were cheap costume shoes, so I can't really blame that on the sock, but if you want the bottoms to stay white, beware colorful shoes. I thought I might wear them with ankle boots in a non-costume outfit, but they kept sort of slinking into my boot and with the scraggly edges, I wasn't crazy about looking like my feet were unraveling all day. I give them three stars, but I would just buy them if you have a one-night costume need and then toss them.\"],[\"The product is just okay for me, it would have been perfect if the whole socks were made of lace\"],[\"I already had a pair of these that I have owned for over ten years and are still in great shape, and decided to get a couple more to go with some Mary Jane shoes I bought.  They fit nicely, the ruffle is super pretty and holds up after many washings.  Unlike other ruffled ankle socks, the lace stays crisp and the nylon sock does not stretch out of shape and fall down.  I love them!\"],[\"The socks are cute.
